## E-Mail-Template-Handler

- My first real C++ project ever!

- Still in development, so it doesnt really work and will take some time, before it will!

- Renders a single .html file of a collection of html, css, js files

### What will you be able to with it?

My plan for this program is to be a watcher, that collects several configurable files and file types to create an E-Mail-Template (for example, could be everything that uses a single .html file) as a single file.

Yeah, that exists, but i still want to do it by myself in C++.



### Installation

Make sure you have following libraries installed on your system:
- nlohmann/json.hpp


Note: Make sure that the paths to the lib's in the compile.sh's are right.
You can create a compile.local.sh!

##### Currently there is only the compile.sh:

- ./compile.sh -> creates executable
- ./compile.sh -s -> compiles and runs the executable

- Note: There are vscode tasks for this as well!
